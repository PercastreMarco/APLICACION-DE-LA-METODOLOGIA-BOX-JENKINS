# Application of the Box-Jenkins Methodology

The Box-Jenkins methodology has been used in a wide range of applications, including the following:

- Financial forecasting: The Box-Jenkins methodology is used to forecast stock prices, interest rates, and other financial indicators.
 
- Weather forecasting: The Box-Jenkins methodology is used to forecast the weather, such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity.
  
- Industrial forecasting: The Box-Jenkins methodology is used to forecast product demand, inventory levels, and other industrial indicators.

For this project, the methodology for forecasting the stock prices of companies listed on a stock exchange is used.

The purpose of this paper is to present a statistical tool for univariant analysis for the prediction of a company that trades in a continuous market and the target price of the company, that is, its stock. The application of this model is useful for the valuation of stocks and companies, as well as the prediction of volatility. Its only disadvantage is that, since it is a model that takes into account a single variable, there is no possibility of relating it to other variables that affect the value of a company's shares. However, this model is still very useful when a short-term prediction is desired due to its statistical application, which makes it a very useful model for making predictions of stock market values.
